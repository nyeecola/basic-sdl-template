## How to run the example

- First install `SDL2` using your distro's package manager (if you're on Ubuntu, its the `libsdl2-dev` package).
- Make sure to also install `SDL2_image` and `SDL2_ttf`.
- Finally, install `cpp-check`, which is a tool we use to check for errors on our code.
- Then, just run `make`.
